# DevGram

Social media for developers by developers

# Procedures

## Enabling Color Mode

Chakra provides us with color mode like `light` and `dark` which can be toggles using the `colorModeSwitch`

## Creating a Navigation Bar

Our navigation bar is going to be simple. This consists of a icon, a search input and colorModeSwitch.

## Creating A Responsive Layout

We are going to use `grid` system provided by chakra to create responsive landing of our social media.

## Creating SideBar

Using `ListItem` and `ListIcon` components, we will render the side-bar. Routing through the side bar will be added later on.
